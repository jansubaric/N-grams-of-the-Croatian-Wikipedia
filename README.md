# N-grams-of-the-Croatian-Wikipedia
This project combines the power of Bash scripting for web scraping and C programming for N-gram analysis, providing a comprehensive toolkit for linguistic exploration and research.

## This repository contains:

+ **Scraping Script**: A Bash script meticulously crafted to scrape all articles from the Croatian Wikipedia, extracting clean, structured text data for subsequent analysis. This script utilizes efficient web scraping techniques to navigate the Wikipedia pages, retrieve article content, and store it in a format suitable for further processing.

+ **N-gram Analyzer**: A C program designed to analyze the extracted text data and generate N-grams of letters or words. This analyzer employs efficient algorithms to compute the frequency distribution of N-grams, allowing for detailed examination of linguistic patterns and phenomena within the Croatian Wikipedia corpus.
